Our shooting range gives you a chance to practice when you land, but hunting is all about getting out in the field and tracking down those deer... And White Hart is a great island for doing that, with 8 square miles of forest and mountains just waiting to be explored. Trek hard enough and you might even make it as far as our sister lodge, way down on South Cliff..."
